\chapter{Evaluation}
Evaluation of the Laha framework involves deploying reference Laha-compliant DSNs, validating the data collected from the reference implementations, and then comparing and contrasting various metrics for each of the proposed goals. Metrics will be collected during a set of experiments for each of the Laha reference implementations in early 2019. 

The following sections describe my plans for deployment of reference implementations, data validation, evaluating the main goals of the Laha framework, and evaluating the tertiary goals of the Laha framework.

\section{Deploy Laha reference implementations on test sites}
In Q4 2018, 10 to 20 Laha-compliant OPQBoxes will be deployed on the University of Hawaii at Manoa's power microgrid. Using a provided blueprint of the microgrid as a guide and collaborating with the Office of Energy Management, these sensors will be placed strategically with the hopes of observing PQ signals on the same line, PQ signals generated from intermittent renewables, local PQ signals, global PQ signals, and PQ signals near sensitive lab electronics. Many of these sensors will be co-located with industry standard PQ monitoring systems. The industry standard sensors provide both ground truth and a means of comparison between a Laha designed network and a non-Laha designed network.. 

In Q4 2018,  20 to 30 Laha-compliant Lokahi sensors will be deployed near and around the Infrasound Laboratory in Kailua-Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii. These sensors will be placed strategically around a calibrated infrasound source. The sensors will be placed with the assistance of Dr. Milton Garces to ensure that I can target sensors at different distances by tuning the amplitude and frequencies of the infrasound signal. In this way, I know which devices should or should not have received the signal.

\section{Validate data collected by Laha deployment}
Beginning in Q1 2019, I will begin validated data collection from both the OPQ network and the Lokahi network. 

Data will be validated in the OPQ network be comparing detected and classified signals against industry standard meters that are co-located with our sensors. Data validation will be an autonomous process that validates signals and trends seen in both the industry sensor and the OPQ sensors. Data validation will provide metrics for signals and trends that the reference sensors observed but OPQ sensors did not (false negatives) as well as signals that the OPQ sensors observed and the reference sensors did not (false negatives).  Specifically, I will be looking to compare long term trends (voltage, frequency, and THD readings over a time period of days) as well as more transient signals of interest (i.e. voltage sags/swells, frequency variations, excessive THD, and outages).

Data from the Lokahi network will be validated against industry standard infrasound sensors. We also control the amplitude and frequency of the signals generated from the calibrated infrasound source and can use geophysical equations to predict which sensors should have seen or not seen an infrasonic signal. Data validation is autonomous for this network as well. Similar to the OPQ network, I will be collecting metrics on false positive and false negatives as compared to the reference sensors. 

Data validation for both networks will continue for all data collection until the end of the project.

\section{Use Laha deployments to evaluate the main goals of the framework}
The Laha deployments for both OPQ and Lokahi will be used to evaluate each of the main goals this framework claims to provide. Namely that Laha is a generally useful framework representation for DSNs. Second, Laha provides the ability to turn primitive sensor data into actionable data and insights. Third, Laha's tiered management of sensor data provides metrics on maximum bounds for storage requirements and graceful degradation of DSN performance. 

Each deployment requires different techniques for performing evaluation. 

In the OPQ deployment, OPQBoxes are deployed and co-located with industry standard, calibrated, reference sensors. Each of these sensors cost thousands to obtain and install, collect all the data all the time, and can only be connected to the power main as it enters a building. These sensors provide a means for verifying signals received or not received by OPQ, as well as confirming long term trend data. I have been provided access to these sensors and stored data via the Office of Energy Management at UH Manoa. The data is accessible via an HTTP API. The Office of Energy Management at UH Manoa has also provided the full schematics for the UH power grid. This will be used as a ground truth for topology estimates and distributed signal analysis. OPQBoxes are placed in strategic locations on the UH Manoa campus specifically in order to evaluate the distributed nature of PQ signals. For example, OPQBoxes are placed on the same electrical lines as well as separate electrical lines to observe how PQ signals travel through an electrical grid.

In the Lokahi deployment, I have the opportunity to generate infrasound signals using a calibrated infrasound source \cite{park2009rotary}.. The source can be tuned to produce infrasound at configurable frequencies and amplitudes. The source works by attaching a variable pitch propeller to an electric motor that can be driven by a waveform generator. The source can generate signals that can be observed at large stand off distances, over tens of kilometers. Similar to the OPQ deployment, sensors within the Lokahi deployment will be co-located with industry standard, calibrated, infrasound sensors. These sensors can provide a metric of signals that were correctly observed, incorrectly observed, or not observed at all by the Lokahi deployment. Further, infrasound itself is characterized quite well by various geophysical equations. These equations can be used to predict if sensors deployed in the Lokahi deployment are likely to observe generated infrasound signals.

Evaluation of the main goals of this network are provided in the following sections.

\subsection{Evaluation of the Generality of this Framework}
I claim that the Laha framework is useful and general enough to be applied to DSNs in different domains. To test this, I will design, develop, and deploy two DSNs. The first OPQ, measures distributed PQ signals on the electrical grid. The second, Lokahi, observes infrasound signals traveling through the atmosphere. 

To evaluate the generality of the Laha design, I will provide metrics for whether or not each deployment is able to fulfill the goals of the given network.

I expect the PQ network, OPQ, to be able to detect and classify common PQ issues. I expect OPQ to observe voltage dips, voltages swells, frequency dips, frequency swells, transients, and high levels of THD. A count of these signals will be kept and compared against industry standard PQ meters co-located with each sensor. By comparing these signals to the ground truth, we will be able to tabulate a number of false positives and false negatives. In order to be considered effective, I would expect to be able to classify each of these common PQ signals, collect a set of each of the PQ signals while maintaining a low number of false positives and false negatives as compared to the industry standard sensors. In general, a negative result here would be not being able to detect PQ signals of a specific type or having a high number of false positives or false negatives.

Further, another stated goal of OPQ is to detect and classify distributed PQ incidents. That is, PQ signals that are observed by more than one sensor in situations where OPQ sensors are not co-located. First, I will evaluate if OPQ is capable of detecting distributed PQ signals. I expect OPQ to at least observe one distributed signal during the test deployment, but would not be surprised to see many. By working with the Office for Energy Management at UH Manoa, I will use a list of known PQ source events along with signals collected by OPQ and the industry standard sensors to provide a list of false positives and false negatives for the number of distributed PQ incidents observed by OPQ.

I expect the infrasound network, Lokahi, to be able to securely detect and report on infrasound incidents from a large collection of heterogeneous smartphone based infrasound sensors. This network prioritizes availability and security even in the face of network issues or no network at all. I claim that Laha is a useful framework for a DSN such as this and will evaluate if Laha is able to meet the goals of this network.

To evaluate the effectiveness of Laha as implemented by Lokahi, I will deploy 50 heterogeneous Lokahi smartphone sensors at predetermined distances from a calibrated infrasound source. I will then use the calibrated infrasound source to generate infrasound signals of different amplitudes and frequencies. While signals are being generated, I will disable network access for the sensors to simulate real life network drop outs of sensors. I will disable the networks for time periods of 1 minute, 30 minutes, and 1 hour. 

I will then, for each sensor, calculate the number of false positives and false negatives for detections of infrasound signals. In order for Laha to be a useful framework for Lokahi, Lokahi must demonstrate that not only can it detect infrasound signals at different frequencies and amplitudes, but it must also do this while maintaining a low number of false positives or false negatives. 

Further, as availability is a major priority of this network, network outages must be handled without signal loss. To evaluate this goal, I will measure the amount of false negatives (or missed signals) due to Laha's data management and the interplay with network outages. I would expect that if Lokahi implements it correctly, we should not see a rise in false negatives. A less great result would be an increase in false negatives.

Finally, backed by the metrics for both deployments, I will provide a critical discussion on what types of DSNs Laha is well suited for and what types of DSNs Laha is not well suited for. This will include a discussion on which parts of the Laha design are useful or a detriment to a given goal of the DSN.

The following sections continue to discuss the evaluation strategies required to show that Laha is a generally useful representation for a DSN.

\subsection{Evaluation of Converting Primitive Data into Actionable Insights}
An important goal of any DSN is to convert primitive sensor data into actionable insights. This is generally accomplished by adding some kind of context associated with the data such as classifications of a signal or linking the data with other data by comparing similarities in time, space, or other physical features.

I claim that Laha's use of Actors acting on and moving data between levels in the Laha hierarchy provides a useful and generic approach to systematically adding context to data as it moves through the framework. Laha is designed with a specific number of levels where data within each level shares the same type. In each deployment, I will evaluate the usefulness of each level with regards to adding context to the data.

An early approach to organizing data for contextualization is the Data Grid project\cite{chervenak2000data} which proposed needing two services for building higher level extractions, storage systems and metadata management. This framework provided the context on top of data needed to easily build replication services for the data, which was important since one of the major goals of this framework was data availability and policy management. Data Grid also maintains data uniformity and does not allow complex schemas. Data Grid does not provide a mechanism for discarding noisy data. Laha differs from Data Grid by providing support for complex metadata schemas, focuses on data reduction strategies, and provides more support for driving context. A more recent paper from Wu et al.\cite{wu2014data} presents the HACE framework which is a framework designed for applying context to Big Data by making integration with other data sources and performing data fusion a first class member of the framework. This paper also examines algorithms for mining of complex and dynamic data, such as those generated from sensor networks. Laha differs from HACE by using a tiered approach to manage data volume while still hopefully generating actionable insights.

In both deployments, I will evaluate the number of false negatives for incident classification. Each level in the framework is responsible for not only adding context, but deciding if data should be moved upward through the levels, adding more context along the way, or discarding data because a level does not think the data is ``interesting". I will keep track of the number of false negatives and which level was responsible for discarding the data with the signal. Using this approach, I will evaluate the effectiveness of each level to determine which levels correctly identify signals and which levels do not correctly identify signals, thus discarding the data.

In order to be useful, I expect each level to add context to the data while maintaining a low level of false negatives.

Using these metrics, I will provide a discussion on which domains a leveled approach may work well for versus which domains a leveled approach might not provide useful benefits.

I claim that Laha is able to provide even more context and actionable insights by implementing a level called Phenomena. Phenomena utilize predictive analytics to provide context and actionable insights over the sensor domain. First, I will evaluate if Phenomena take place in practice for both of the Laha deployments. 

To evaluate Phenomena in the OPQ network, OPQ must observe a cyclical incident such as voltage swells occurring every afternoon due to solar output or an electric motor turning on at the same time every day. Once a cyclical incident is observed, OPQ must correctly create predictive Phenomena that predict the same incident happening in the future. Assuming predictive Phenomena are created, I will measure the amount of false positives and false negatives on whether the predictions were correct or not. A positive result would show that now only is OPQ capable of making predictive Phenomena, but also that a high percentage (> 50\%) of the predictions are correct.

Evaluation of predictive Phenomena in the Lokahi infrasound network will follow a similar strategy. However, since I can control the infrasound source, I can actually run an experiment that creates cyclical and non-cyclical signals. I will then test Lokahi's ability to not only create predictive Phenomena, but also show that the predictions are accurate, that is, greater than 50\% of them are correct. 

A negative result would be that if either of the networks are not able to create predictive Phenomena or a large number of false positives or false negatives (combining for <50\% prediction accuracy).

Adding context to classified Incidents is the act of providing a statistical likelihood of the underlying cause of the Incident. These include things like showing that a voltage sag is caused by turning on the dryer every day at 2PM or an identifying as infrasound signal as a repetitive flight pattern near an airport. Context is provided by external sources to the DSN (such as users or by performing data fusion with other correlating data sets).

Evaluating contextualized events consists of setting up experiments where I assign context for a specific set of signals and resulting Incidents. Then testing to see if Phenomena are able to correctly apply context to Incidents when the same signals are generated again. I will record the number of false positives and false negatives for assigning context to Incidents.

A positive result would be to see the correct context applied to incidents more than half of the time. That is, I expect context to be applied correctly to at more than 50\% of Incidents for which context has been previously defined.

I expect to see contextualization work better in DSNs where signals provide more measures for discrimination. For example, PQ networks contain many different types of classified PQ signals, however there is a small subset of causes attributed to each type of PQ signal classification.This decreases Laha's search space and in theory should make it easier to provide context.

\subsection{Evaluation of Tiered Management of Big Data}\label{eval-big-data}
The goal of tiered management of Big Data is to add a mechanism that provides a maximum bounds on storage requirements of sensor data at each level in the Laha hierarchy while simultaneously reducing sensor noise as Laha Actors move ``interesting" data upwards. This in turn should decrease the amount of false positives since forwarded data is more likely to include signals of interest and less likely to be sensor noise. 

Other approaches to Big Data management include compression\cite{tang2004compression} or storage systems where the goal is to have a distributed file system and move data close to where it is being processed, such as the Hadoop Distributed File System\cite{warrier2007much}. Other systems such as NiFi\cite{hughes2016survey} provide a nice interface for ingestion and movement of data between Big Data tools while also providing data provenance, but do not go far enough in focusing on data reduction and graceful degradation. Carney et al.\cite{carney2002monitoring} discuss how monitoring applications require management and clean up of stale sensor data.

It's not yet known if I will see a decrease in false negatives. On the one hand, it's possible that Laha will throw away data that did contain signals of interest. In this case, detection or classification Actors will not observe the signals because the data has been discarded leading to increased false negatives. On the other hand, by reducing false positives and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio as data moves upward, Phenomena has a better chance of optimizing triggering, detection, and classification which may in turn inform Laha to save data that would have been previously thrown away. In this way, it's possible that Laha will reduce false negatives.

We will evaluate the number of false positives and false negatives in detections, classifications, and Phenomena compared against industry standard reference sensors. A positive outcome for this metric would be a reduction in both false positives and false negatives compared to an approach that does not use tiered data management. A negative result would be an increase in either false positives or false negatives. 

During the acquisition and curating of data, metrics will be collected and stored about how much data is saved (in bytes) versus how much data is discarded at each level within the Laha data hierarchy. These numbers will be compared against data storage as if the OPQ and Lokahi frameworks were to take a ``store everything" approach. Evaluation metrics provided will include percentage of data storage saved per data hierarchy level as well as an estimate of overall decrease in data storage requirements for the entire DSN. A positive result from these metrics would show significant reduction in storage requirements for each level in the framework compared against a ``store everything approach" and other state-of-the-art data storage solutions.

I will also provide metrics on ``continuous storage pressure" which is a measure of the average amount of data storage required at each level given the current state of the network. That is, since data at all lower levels of the framework assigns a TTL to the data within the collection, the collection will exhibit a constant data pressure during sensor data collection. For example, at the lowest level, the IML collects raw data from all sensors all the time. Given the sample rate per sensor, the size per sample, the number of sensors, and a known TTL for this level, I can estimate the maximum bounds of data management requirements that the IML requires. We can develop similar estimation strategies with higher levels of the framework. I will compute the statistical error between the predicted storage pressure and the actual storage pressure recorded during the experiments. A positive outcome would show strong correlation between the predicted storage pressure and the actual storage pressure. A negative outcome would show weak correlation between the predicted and actual values.

Finally, I will provide an evaluation that weighs the results of all three metrics against each other. For example, if I see positive results for data storage reduction and negative results for false positives, do the benefits of the data storage reduction outweigh the negatives of increased false positives?

I would expect that DSNs that have a lower signal-to-noise ratio will see greater benefits from tiered data management than DSNs that already have a decent signal-to-noise ratio.

\section{Evaluation of Tertiary Goals}
In order to achieve the main goals of this framework, I claim that either all or a subset of the following tertiary goals must be fulfilled. Optimization of triggering, detection, classification, sensor energy usage, bandwidth, predictive analytics, and the ability to derive models of the underlying sensing field topology. 

To evaluate these tertiary goals, I will select and implement DSN optimization techniques from current literature. I will then compare and contrast the usefulness of different techniques and discuss how each of these techniques perform in the different sensor domains.

Finally, I will discuss how each of these tertiary goals make progress towards overall goals of this sensor network.

\subsection{Evaluation of Adaptive Optimizations for Triggering}
Triggering is the act of observing a feature extracted data stream for interesting features and triggering sensors to provide raw data for a requested time window for higher level analysis. Adaptively optimizing triggering is a way to tune triggering algorithms and parameters with the aim of decreasing false positives and false negatives. In this context, a false positive is triggering on a data stream that does not contain a signal of interest and a false negative is not triggering on a data stream that does contain a signal of interest. 

Adaptive triggering is only useful in networks that utilize triggering. Specifically, this technique can not be applied to DSNs that take a collect everything all the time approach.

Triggering can also have significant impacts on overall sensor power requirements and DSN bandwidth requirements. Many of the optimizing triggering algorithms present in the literature exist to minimize sensor energy requirements and bandwidth requirements. This is addressed in great detail in the literature review by Anastasi et al. \cite{anastasi_energy_2009}. This is accomplished by reducing communications between sensor nodes and the sink. It's argued in \cite{pottie2000wireless} that the cost of transmitting a single bit of information from a sensor cost approximately the same as running 1000 operations on that sensor now. However, there is some contention on this topic as \cite{alippi_adaptive_2010} argues that in some modern sensors computational requirements can equal or eclipse those of  sensor communication.  

Even if a DSN utilizes triggering, it's not clear that adaptive triggering even takes place. The first question I will evaluate is, does adaptive optimization of triggering take place at all given the domain of the DSN? That is, does the nature of the underlying sensor field contribute to optimization of triggering? I will compare if and how optimizations take place in the two reference networks for the domains of PQ and infrasound.

In order to evaluate triggering efficiency within our Laha deployments, Laha will only adaptively modify triggering for half of the devices in the OPQ deployment. In the Lokahi deployment, I will run the same experiment twice. The first run will not optimize triggering and the second run will optimize triggering.

Once the experiments have been run, I will first determine if optimization of triggering has occurred, and if it did, compare the number of false negatives and false positives against the runs that did not use optimized triggering or where optimization did not occur. 

I hope to show that a side effect of Laha's optimized triggering is reduced bandwidth and sensor energy requirements. To this end, I will calculate metrics for total data sent and received at the sink node of each network for each device in the network. A positive result would show decreased bandwidth usage for devices that utilize optimized triggering. A negative result would show similar or more bandwidth usage for devices that utilize optimized triggering.

I further hope to show that another benefit of Laha's optimized triggering is reduced sensor energy requirements. The evaluation for this metric will occur with the Lokahi network where sensors can be dependent on batteries. I will run two experiments. For each experiment, all sensors will be charged to battery level of 100\%. In the first experiment, I will not utilize optimized triggering. In the second experiment I will utilize optimized triggering. In both experiments, I will measure the final battery level after the experiment and also measure how quickly the battery depletes for each sensor. This is possible because data in the Lokahi network contains timestamped entries with battery levels.

\subsection{Evaluation of Adaptive Optimizations for Detection and Classifications}
Detections occur when triggering observes something ``interesting" in the feature extracted data stream. A Detection is a contiguous window of raw sensor data that was requested by triggering that may or may not contain signals of interest. Optimizing detections involves optimized the window sizes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the window. Fine grained features are then computed by Detection Actors and moved to the Incidents Level where classification of signals takes place. Optimizing Detections involves trimming detection windows to increase signal-to-noise. Optimizing of classifications for Incidents involves tuning parameter sets for the underlying classification algorithms. 

Predictive and Locality Phenomena as well as topology optimizations will be used to provide optimizations to the Detections and Incidents levels. 

Evaluation of adaptive optimizations for detection and classification within the Laha network will be conducted differently for each Laha deployment.

In the Lokahi deployment, I will control the production of infrasound signals using the available infrasound source. I will run two experiments, where the amplitudes and frequencies of the signals are the same and the locations of the devices remain invariant. In the first experiment, Laha will not use optimized detection or classification provided by Phenomena. In the second experiment, Laha will use optimized detection and classification techniques provided by Phenomena. 

With known frequencies and amplitudes of the infrasound signals, I can compare the rate of detections and classifications between the optimized and unoptimized experimental runs. I expect to see a greater number of and more accurate detections and classifications from the optimized experiment.

In the OPQ deployment, I will compare the same metrics as the Lokahi deployment, but instead of controlling the source signal, I will co-locate OPQBoxes. In each pair of co-located OPQBoxes, one will be analyzed using Phenomena optimized detection and classification algorithms and the other will be analyzed using unoptimized detection and classification algorithms.

I will collect and evaluate the number of false positives and false negatives for Incidents generated with optimization and without optimization. A positive outcome would include a decrease in either false positives, false negatives, or both. A negative result would be an increase in either or both false positives or false negatives.

I will also calculate the signal-to-noise ration in Detections to determine if optimization of detections is working. A positive outcome would be an increase in the signal-to-noise ration and a negative outcome would be similar or a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio.

\subsection{Evaluation of Model of Underlying Sensor Field Topology}
Laha should be able to build a model of the underlying sensing field topology. This is not the topology of the physical layout of the sensors (this is generally already known a priori or by collecting location information), but rather the topology by which signals travel. For example, in a PQ network the topology is the physical power grid and switches that PQ signals travel through. In an infrasound network, the topology is the atmosphere through which sound waves travel. Laha aims to build a statistical model of the distances between sensors according to the topology of the sensing field by observing recurrent incidents over time. This can perhaps shed some light on understanding the topology of a sensing field without knowing anything about it before hand.

Much of the literature on topology management is written to decrease sensor energy requirements by exploiting the density of sensors within a sensing field topology. For example, the ASCENT\cite{cerpa2004ascent} framework provides adaptive self configuring sensors that exploit topology denseness to decrease sensor energy usage. Several other frameworks have been designed with the same goal of reducing energy usage by exploiting topology\cite{schurgers2002stem},\cite{schurgers2002topology}.

To evaluate the model of the sensing field topology, I will take two different approaches for each Laha deployment. In both deployment, the sensing field topology is known beforehand to provide a ground truth. I will then compare Laha's computed signal distance between sensors to the actual signal distance between sensors as provided by the ground truths.

In the Lokahi deployment, sensors will be strategically placed at different distances from an infrasound source. Some sensors will be close to each other geographically, but separated by terrain that infrasound signals will not easily travel through. By moving the infrasound source, I can expect to see infrasound signals arriving or not arriving at the sensors depending on the source and direction of the signal along with the physical features of the land. By performing multiple experiments, I hope to provide a model of the physical environment topology that Laha has built. I will compare Laha's model to the known topology and provide a statistical error analysis. 

In the OPQ deployment, sensors will be strategically placed on like and unlike electrical lines to observe how distributed PQ signals move through a power grid. In this deployment, Laha will build a topology model that doesn't show physical geographic distance between sensors, but instead will build a model of the electrical distance between sensors. This data will be evaluated by comparing the electrical distances found by the Laha model to the actual UH power grid as referenced by the schematic provided by the Office of Energy Management at UH Manoa. A statistical error analysis of the differences between electrical distances between the model and the schematic will be provided as an evaluation metric.

A positive outcome would be to show that there is high correlation between the Laha signal distances and the ground truth distances. A negative outcome would show low correlation.

Assuming high correlation and a statistical model of the sensing field, I would like to evaluate if Laha is able to use this information to optimize triggering, classification, or predictive analytics. In order to evaluate this, I will collect the number of false positives and false negatives at all levels in the Laha hierarchy while optimizing from topology and without optimizing from topology. I expect to see less false positives and less false negatives when utilizing topology optimizations. A negative result would be a larger number of false positives or false negatives.

I expect to only see results in networks where signals travel fast enough to create a statistical difference between arrival times at the various sensors. In sensing fields where signals travel slowly and uniformly (i.e. a temperature collection DSN), it may be more difficult or impossible to actually determine the sensing field topology.
