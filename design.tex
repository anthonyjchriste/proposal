\chapter{System Design}
Laha, which means, to spread or distribute in Hawaiian, is an abstract framework for distributed sensor networks that provides a means for big data management as well as augmenting a DSN with the ability to adaptively optimize its bandwidth, detection, classification, and sensor device power requirements.

The Laha framework is made up of five layers that can be viewed conceptually as a pyramid (see \ref{laha-figure}). Data entering the Laha framework is located at the bottom the bottom of the pyramid. As data moves upward through the layers, noise is discarded, less interesting events are discarded or aggregated into upper layers, events are given more meaning and context, and associations and predictions are made.

\section{Seven proposed benefits of Laha} \label{laha-benefits}
Laha is designed to adaptively optimize the collection, triggering, detection, and classification of signals within a DSN. These optimizations provide several benefits to DSNs. Many of these benefits can be found in other DSNs, but generally only appear as a single optimization (TODO: CITE) or as a subset of optimizations (TODO: CITE). Laha is the first DSN to combine all of these benefits for the purpose of auto-optimizing the network.

\subsection{Tiered management of Big Data}
% TODO If you're going to use "Big Data" as a term of art, then it needs to be rigorously defined.
% TODO What I think you need to emphasize here is that in any Big Data scenario, you simply can't keep all the data around forever. So, what approach will be used to decide what data to keep and what data to discard?  Laha addresses this problem by having a series of levels, each with its own TTL.  This approach has the benefit of simplifying the analysis of bandwidth and storage requirements for a DSN, but at the cost of potentially discarding important data due to the "use it or lose it" design.  Part of youer evaluation should attempt to address this weakness of use it or lose it.

Laha provides tiered management of the Big Data that the framework consumes. This is mainly accomplished using the layered approach that Laha provides. All data within the Laha framework is garbage collected using a configurable time to live (TTL) for each layer. As data moves from the bottom to the top of the framework, noise is discarded and only interesting data as determined by the higher layers is preserved and forwarded upwards within the framework. In this way, the network can be tuned to preserve increasingly important data. The details of Laha's tiered approach can be found in section \ref{big-data-management}.

\subsection{Automatically provide context to classified incidents}
% TODO This is a feature that will be hopefully much more easily evaluated once you have the two reference implementations.  I will be interested to see what kinds of contextual information are attached, and whether there are times you wished you could attach information elsewhere.
Laha provides Annotations Phenomena (see \ref{annotations-phenomena}) that allows users or algorithms to tag signals of interest with contextual information. There is already a large amount of research for providing classifications of signals of interest, however annotations provide context about the classifications themselves. That is, Laha provides the ability to assign causality to already classified signals.

Initially, a library of annotations is required to be built for a particular DSN. Once the library has been built, Laha can provide automatic annotation assignment using similarity metrics. By using annotations and determining causality, it's possible to create actionable responses to signals observed within a network.

Further, annotations can be used to optimize detection and classification of known signals. For example, imagine a power quality network that observes a voltage sag on the same sensors at the same time periodically. If the cause of the voltage sag can be determined (such as a motor turning on), then detection of this signal can either be muted or analyzed more deeply. Also, other voltage sags that exhibit similar characteristics can then be automatically annotated.

\subsection{Adaptive optimizations for triggering}
% TODO This seems totally cool, but I question whether this is a novel feature. Adaptive setting of thresholds must happen in lots of different domains.  You'll want to discuss related work here, and hopefully argue that other approaches are ad-hoc and domain-specific, but the contribution of Laha is to build adaptive optimization of triggering directly into the framework as a first-class concept. 
Many triggering schemes rely on thresholds being surpassed within feature extracted data streams. For example, triggered data streams in a power quality network might consist of voltage, frequency, and THD extracted features to determine if there is likely a signal of interest observed from a given set of sensors. If any of the extracted features surpass a preset threshold, then we  end up triggering the devices for raw, higher fidelity data. However, there are cases where the feature extracted stream may not surpass a predefined threshold and those sensors would not be triggered.

By using different types of Phenomena, we can improve our triggering efficiency. For example, Locality Phenomena, as discussed in section \ref{locality-phenomena}, allow us to predict detections and classifications in space. If a particular grouping of sensors that are related in space always observe the same detections and classifications, then we can build a predictive model of when the framework can expect to see those things. In this way, a sensor may trigger on a passed threshold, but other sensors that are co-located may not trigger because feature extracted data is below the triggering threshold. If the Locality Phenomena predicts that other co-located sensors should have detected the same signal, then we might trigger those devices for high fidelity data to determine if the signal is in the raw data stream even though it didn't meet the triggering threshold.

Laha can use Periodicity Phenomena, as discussed in section \ref{periodicity-phenomena}, in similar ways. When periodic signals are classified, we can create Future Phenomena that predicts when signals of interest should be detected and classified. This allows Laha to optimize triggering by tuning the triggers to specifically look for Periodic or Future Phenomena. Periodic and Future Phenomena also allows Laha to tune classification algorithms to the predicted classifications.

\subsection{Adaptive optimizations for detection and classification}
Not only can Laha optimize triggering, but similar usages of Locality and Future phenomena can be utilized to improve detection and classification efficiency. With Locality Phenomena, a model of common detections and classifications can be built for a set of co-located sensors. Detection and classification algorithms can be tuned to search for specific signals that are often observed within this model, pruning the search space and increasing the accuracy of detection and classification algorithms.

Future and Periodic Phenomena provide the same benefits to detection and classification as Locality Phenomena. That is, if Laha is able to predict when a signal is going to arrive and also predict how that signal is going to be classified, then it can tune its detection and classification algorithms specifically for the signal of interest.

\subsection{Provides a model of underlying sensor field topology}
% TODO Either this is extremely cool, or totally frivolous, and I'm not sure which. it is frivolous if the only thing it's doing is detecting topology that you already know about (i.e. that two OPQ boxes are close together physically, but we already know that because of their lat/long coordinates.) it is totally cool if you are detecting topology that is not already known. So, it would be good to provide a specific example here for both domains (OPQ and Lokahi)

Predictive phenomena use localization of signals to build communities or groupings of sensors that observe similar signals in both time and space. Over time, Laha can begin to build a model of the underlying topology of the sensing field. For instance, if a group of sensors always see the same signal, then we can assume that either the signal has a far reach, or the sensors are grouped together geographically. With enough sensor penetration, we can differentiate between these two scenarios.

Further, if the sensors provide any sort of location information, Laha can provide a mapping from physical location to sensor field topology. This is especially useful when the topology of the sensor field is not known a priori. Even if we know the location of the sensors at all times, that does not mean that we understand the topology of the sensing field. For example, in a PQ network, the topology is defined by how the electrical grid is connected to itself and laid out. Laha hopes to provide a model that can determine the electrical distance between devices even if the topology of the grid is not known. As another example, take an infrasound network. It's possible that two sensors are located close to each other geographically, but if they have a large mass between them, they may not receive the same signals due to the topology of the environment around them. 

In this sense, Laha is not interested in knowing the location of sensors relative to each other, but is more interested in understanding how signals flow between sensors as a constraint on the topology that the signals travel through.


\subsection{Decreased bandwidth of entire DSN}
One of the tertiary benefits of optimizing triggering and classification is that we get decreased bandwidth usage for free. By improving triggering efficiency, its possible to trigger less devices for raw data when something interesting is observed in the triggering stream.

Predictive phenomena allow us to target triggers to sensors that are most likely to have captured a signal of interest. For instance, if a geographical grouping of sensors tend to always observe the same signals of interest, then we can use that grouping to optimize triggering. Instead of triggering all devices in an area to search for the signal, we can trigger only on the specific grouping that is most likely have observed the signal. We can also selectively ignore sensors within a predictive grouping if Laha assumes that all sensors observed the signal, then we may only need to analyze the signal from one of the sensors rather than all of the sensors in the grouping.

\subsection{Minimizing sensor power requirements}
In general, sensors are both compute and energy constrained. Most of the time, communications are the main source of sensor device power requirements within a DSN.

In an energy constrained DSN where communications amount for the most usage of energy, decreased bandwidth also provides decreased sensor device power requirements. This can prolong the life of DSNs or provide more energy for other parts of the network (such a pushing computations to the edge).

\section{Big Data Management in Laha} \label{big-data-management}
The Laha framework acts as an adaptive sieve for filtering noise and uninteresting data collected from a DSN. In this way, each layer only passes what it considers interesting to the layer above it. All data at a particular layer is garbage collected at specific intervals relating to its important to the DSN.

Each layer only keeps data for a specified amount of time before it is garbage collected. As data moves up the pyramid, it is generally considered more useful and therefore has a longer Time to Live (TTL), the amount of the time the data lives before it is garbage collected.  When a higher layer detects ``something interesting", the data contained in the time window of ``something interesting" is copied into the layers above it and will still persist even though the original data is garbage collected. In this way, we preserve data from all layers if they are associated with interesting data. 

A summary of how data management in Laha is provided in table \ref{data-managament-table}. Note that the TTL is configurable for each implementing network and the table provides default values.

\begin{table}
	\caption{Summary of data management in Laha}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline 
		Layer & Description & Time-to-Live (TTL) \\ 
		\hline 
		Phenomena Layer (PL) & Contextual \& predictive analytics &  \\ 
		\hline 
		Incidents Layer (IL) & Classified signals &  1 year \\ 
		\hline 
		Detections Layer (DL) & Triggered windowed raw data & 1 week  \\ 
		\hline 
		Aggregate Measurements Layer (AML) & Statistical aggregates of raw data  & 1 day  \\ 
		\hline 
		Instantaneous Measurements Layer (IML) & Raw sensor data  & 1 hour \\ 
		\hline 
	\end{tabular} 
    \label{data-managament-table}
\end{table}

\subsection{Instantaneous Measurements Layer}
The Instantaneous Measurements Layer (IML) receives raw, sampled data from the DSN. The amount of data received is determined by the sample rate of each device multiplied by the number of fields per sample. Most of the time samples, from devices in the network are mainly sampling noise. A large percentage of the data in this layer is destined for garbage collection and data is assigned a Time to Live (TTL) of one hour. 

\subsection{Aggregate Measurements Layer}
The Aggregate Measurements Layer (AML) is responsible for rolling up IMs from the IML. In general, this layer only works with feature extracted data, rather than working with the raw samples. Each measurement in the AML provides summary statistics over a configurable time window. For example, these can include min, max, mean, median, mode, and variance statistics. 

It's possible to breakup the AML into several sub layers, each with different window sizes. For example, we might roll IMs into one minute AMs, then roll one minute AMs into hour AMs, then days, and so on. Each sublayer within the AML can have its own configurable TTL, ensuring long term summary statistics stick around for as long as needed. This provides us a high level view of the network and can provide insights into long term trends which wouldn't be visible (or available) in the IM data stream.

Similar to IMs, AMs can be saved and copied to the layers above it when interesting data is observed. This ability allows for AMs during these time periods to be stored and saved from the garbage collection process.

At this point in the hierarchy, we are still not providing any context to the data that we are receiving. Context is provided by layers above the AML.

\subsection{Detections Layer}
The Detections Layer (DL) is the first layer that provides some context to the data that the sink is receiving. This layer is responsible watching the feature extracted data streams, and requesting IMs from the IM layer. In general, the detection layer is meant to be trigger happy\footnote{Pun intended.} and be overly aggressive when determining if a feature extracted data stream looks interesting. 

When a data stream looks interesting, the DL marks a timestamp $N$ seconds before the interesting features and $M$ seconds after the interesting features, where both $N$ and $M$ are configurable within the framework. The goal is to use a time window that catches signals of interest within it. Since these data ranges will be further processed and refined higher in the hierarchy, there is no issue with collecting larges amounts of data in this layer. 

The actual methods of detection is dependent on the characteristics of every individual sensor network. This framework assumes that the detection algorithms are provided by the implementing frameworks.

Similar to other layers, the DL layer will have its IMs and AMs copied into layers above it when upper layers observe something interesting in the DL. The detections layer is set to have a TTL of a week.

\subsection{Incidents Layer}
Incidents represent classified signals. Incidents are individual classifications for signals of interest and are created by analyzing waveforms from Events. Waveforms from Events may contain multiple incidents. Individual signals may be classified as multiple incidents (for example a transient being classified as both a transient and frequency incidents). 

Incidents are further analyzed to produce phenomena. 

Incidents are expired after one year of storage. 


\subsection{Phenomena Layer}
Phenomena are defined as a grouping of incidents that provide one or more of annotations, locality, periodicity, predictiveness, similarity, and future phenomena. 

Not only do Phenomena provide interesting insight and analytics into the underlying data, but they also provide a means for adaptively tuning the underlying collection, triggering, detection, and analysis of a distributed sensor network.

Phenomena are summarized in table \ref{phenomena-summary-table} and discussed in great detail in section \ref{phenomena}.

\section{Phenomena: Providing Adaptive Optimizations in Laha} \label{phenomena}

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Summary of Laha Phenomena}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Phenomena & Description \\
		\hline
		Annotations & Provide context about an Incident or set of incidents \\
		\hline
		Locality & Provides context on how incidents are related in time and space \\
		\hline
		Periodicity & Designation for incidents that exhibit repetitive or periodic behavior \\ 
		\hline
		Similarity & Subset of incidents found using grouping and community detection algorithms \\
		\hline
		Predictive & Subset of incidents characterized by predictive or forecasting models\\
		\hline
		Future & Incidents scheduled to occur in the future\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{phenomena-summary-table}
\end{table}

\subsection{Annotations Phenomena} \label{annotations-phenomena}
Annotations provide context about an Incident or a set of Incidents. Annotations are generally user provided or sourced from other data sources to provide supporting context to Incidents. For example, Annotations might include “Cloud Cover”, “Hurricane Hector”, “Dryer Turns On”, etc.

In some sense, annotations allow us to label our data sets beyond a simple classification and start looking at causal classifications. Once enough annotations have been assigned to classified incidents, Laha can used Annotations to attempt to label unknown incidents with similar characteristics.

Annotations can be used to tune Laha's detection and classification algorithms by allowing Laha to filter on incidents with known causes.

\subsection{Locality Phenomena} \label{locality-phenomena}
Locality provides context on how incidents are related to each other in both space in time. Laha is able to determine if classified incidents are local to a single sensor, to a group of co-located sensors, or global across an entire network. Sensors can be co-located in both the physical sense and also co-located within a sensing field. For example, sensors in a power quality network may be separated by large distance geographically, but co-located through the electrical grid and the grid's topology. 

Over time, Locality Phenomena is used to build a model of sensors in relation to each other and to provide a statistical likelihood that co-located sensors will observe the same signal. Locality phenomena can be used to drive network triggering, detection, and classification thresholds within a distributed sensor network by using this probabilistic model for determining the likelihood that a sensor or sensors will observe a signal of interest.

\subsection{Periodicity Phenomena} \label{periodicity-phenomena}
Periodic phenomena consists of incidents that exhibit repetitive behavior, that is, the same types of incidents appearing in cycles from single or multiple devices. Periodicity allows for the easy creation of Predictive phenomena.

Periodic phenomena can come from a single incident or from multiple incidents. Periodic phenomena allow us to either tune our network to find periodic incidents or tune the  network to ignore periodic incidents depending on if the incidents are of interest. Periodic phenomena are especially useful in conjunction with Annotation phenomena as we can assign causality to the periodic signal. 

\subsection{Similarity Phenomena}
Similarity phenomena utilize grouping and community detection algorithms to group incidents together by their features. Common features used for grouping include time, location, incident type, or incident features.

% TODO describe common community detection algorithms 

\subsection{Predictive Phenomena}
Predictive phenomena consists of incidents that are characterized by a predictive or forecasting models. Predictiveness is a behavior that can be inferred from all other phenomena types. 

Predictiveness is the main driver behind optimizing the control of a distributed sensor network. If we can predict the types of signals that will arrive at sensors, then we can tune those sensors and the sink to either filter the signals (if the user is not interested in signals) or tune the sensors and the sink to be extra sensitive to those signals, possible detecting them even if they previously would not have been detected.

\subsection{Future Phenomena}
Predictive phenomena can be used to create future phenomena. Future phenomena are a statistical model of the likelihood of seeing an incident or incidents at future points in time. Knowing that a signal may occur with some probability allows agents affected by those signals time to prepare for the signals.

\section{Laha Actors: Acting on the Laha Data Model}
Laha Actors act on the Laha hierarchy and provide one of two functions. Actors can move data from one level of the hierarchy upwards through the hierarchy when interesting data is requested by an upper level. Actors can also apply adaptive optimizations downwards through the hierarchy. The Laha framework can support multiple actors at each level. For example, the Incidents Layer in our reference power quality network contains actors for each of the following functions: IEEE classified voltage events, frequency variations, power outages, excessive THD, and many others. The Incident Layer Actors move data from these incidents upwards to the Phenomena Layer.  

Table \ref{laha-actors-tables} summarizes the actors that exist within the Laha framework and their purposes. 

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Summary of Laha Actors}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Actor & Purpose \\
		\hline
		IML Actors & Perform feature extraction and move aggregate data to AML \\
		\hline
		AML Actors & Perform triggering on data from IML, copy data to DL if interesting \\
		\hline
		DL Actors & Perform high fidelity feature extraction on possible detections \\
		\hline
		IL Actors & Perform classification and contextualization on possible detections \\
		\hline
		PL Actors & Generate predictive analytics and optimize the lower levels of the hierarchy \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{laha-actors-tables}
\end{table}

\subsection{Actor Constraints}
Actors at each level in the hierarchy are governed by a set of constraints. These constraints include the set of possible inputs, $A_i$, the set of possible outputs, $A_o$, the set of Actors it can receive data from, $A_{ai}$, the set of Actors it can transmit data to, $A_{ao}$, and a set of performance metrics that each actor must maintain, $A_p$. The constraints assigned to each Actor are determined by the hierarchy level in which the Actor resides.  

Actors are responsible for reporting constraint violations and in this way, Actors are the primary provider of health, performance, and status metrics about the Laha framework.

The constraints for each level of Laha hierarchy is summarized in table \ref{actor-constraint-table}.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Summary of Laha Actor Constraints at Each Level}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Level & $A_i$ & $Ao$ & $A_{ai}$ & $A_{ao}$ & $A_p$ \\
		\hline
		IML & Raw samples & Aggregate trends & n/a & AML & Data ranges available \\
		\hline
		AML & Aggregate trends & Detections & IML & DL & Data ranges available \\
		\hline
		DL & Windowed waveforms & Hi-fi extracted features & AML & IL & Data \& features available \\
		\hline
		IL & Hi-fi extracted features & Contextualized incidents & DL & PL & Incident types available \\
		\hline
		PL & Contextualized incidents & Optimizations & IL & All levels & Optimizations available \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{actor-constraint-table}
\end{table}

\section{OPQ: A Laha-compliant Power Quality DSN}
OPQMauka is a middleware component of the Open Power Quality (OPQ) framework. The OPQ project provides a hardware and software solution for monitoring distributed power quality (PQ). The OPQ project was founded with the goal of studying how intermittent distributed renewable energy sources affect PQ not just at a user's home, but also within a user's neighborhood, between neighborhoods, and globally across the grid. 

The OPQ ecosystem is made up of networked hardware sensors (OPQBoxes) and various software services (OPQMakai, OPQMauka OPQHealth, OPQView). Each of these software components are made up of individual services and plugins.

The OPQ system design is laid out in figure \ref{fig:opq-system}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/system-diagram.png}
	\caption{OPQ System Diagram}\label{fig:opq-system}
\end{figure}

\subsection{OPQ: Boxes}
An OPQ Box is a custom designed PQ sensor. OPQBoxes can be plugged into a wall outlet and communicate with OPQ servers using the user's WiFi connection. OPQBoxes consist of a Raspberry PI single board computer (SBC), a custom board for PQ measurements, custom firmware, and a custom enclosure. The custom board contains an ADC that samples an alternating current (AC) power signal at 12 thousand samples per second. This data is transferred to the Raspberry Pi where feature extraction and data transfer takes place. The hardware design is presented in figure \ref{fig:opq-box-design} and the software design is provided in figure \ref{}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{figures/opqbox_diagram.png}
	\caption{OPQ Box Design}\label{fig:opq-box-design}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{figures/opqbox_software.png}
	\caption{OPQ Box Software}\label{fig:opq-box-software}
\end{figure}

The feature extraction algorithms extract from the sampled waveform the following features: windowed $V_{RMS}$, frequency, and total harmonic distortion (THD) features. The feature extracted data is then sent to a central sink where further analysis is used to determine if the sensor or a subset of sensors should be triggered for raw data.

The OPQ network is a hybrid network that uses edge computing for calculating features at the edge of the network. This is opposed to networks that utilize a ``send everything" approach. In this way, we are able to minimize bandwidth. 

OPQBoxes are synchronized to each other and the OPQ back end using the network time protocol (NTP). This provides synchronization to the millisecond level, which although is great for longer incidents, does not provide accurate timing for transients that may be shorter than tens of milliseconds.


\subsection{OPQ: Makai}
OPQ Makai is the central sink and triggering daemon for the OPQ framework. It is made up of several services which are responsible for aggregating and processing the measurements generated by OPQ Boxes. Low fidelity feature extracted data consisting of $V_{RMS}$, frequency, and THD are streamed from OPQ Boxes at a configurable message rate. These data streams are observed by OPQ Makai and the daemon uses statistical methods and thresholds to determine if the sensor or a subset of sensors should be triggered for a window of raw sampled waveforms. 

The OPQMakai system design is provided in figure \ref{fig:makai-main}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{figures/makai_main.pdf}
	\caption{OPQ Makai Design}\label{fig:makai-main}
\end{figure}

\subsection{OPQ: Health}
OPQHealth is a service that continuously monitors both the hardware sensors and the software services that make up the OPQ framework.

OPQHealth detects health issues in the following ways. 

OPQHealth determines if an OPQBox is active or inactive by querying the Mongo database for the most recent aggregate measurement. If there is a record of an aggregate measurement within 5 minutes, the Box is considered up, otherwise it is considered down.

The status of OPQMakai is determined by Makai inserting special health events into the Mongo database. Health queries for the presence of these events and if events are not observed within 1 minute, the OPQMakai service is considered down.

OPQMauka provides a special HTTP endpoint that is only accessible within the OPQ back end network that when accessed with a \textit{GET} request will return with a status of \textit{200 OK} if the service is up and available. Any other response of the absence of the response is considered a failure more for OPQMauka.

MongoDB is monitored by querying for a sentinel value that was previously placed in the database.

OPQView is monitored by sending a \textit{GET} request to the landing page. A response of \textit{200 OK} means that the health service is up. Any other response or the lack of response is an indication of failure for OPQView.

OPQHealth stores its findings in both the Mongo database as well as in a traditional log file.

\subsection{OPQ: View}
OPQView is a web application that provides visualization, notification, and user management services for data, sensors, and user accounts with the OPQ framework. OPQView is built using Meteor.js and provides a Reactive view of the underlying data stored in the OPQ database.

A screenshot of OPQView in action is provided in figure \ref{fig:opq-view}.

\section{Lokahi: A Laha-compliant Infrasound DSN}
Lokahi is a dynamic DSN that originally evolved as a distributed infrasound detection network. Infrasound is characterized as sound waves that are less than 20 Hz. Infrasound generally can not be deciphered by the human ear, but it can be detected using microphone and barometric pressure sensors. Any large movements of the atmosphere can produce infrasound. The Lokahi network was designed to supplement the International Monitoring System (IMS) for the capture  of undeclared and declared nuclear explosions. Lokahi has been successfully used to capture signals from volcanoes, hurricanes, aircraft, meteors, and other large atmospheric events. 

Sensors in Lokahi are any mobile device that can run iOS or Android. We have sensors distributed world wide. The software stack for Lokahi consists of a distributed actor system for data acquisition, MongoDB for metadata persistence, Apache Kafka for data queues and interprocess communication, Python and related scientific libraries for analysis, and a distributed key-value store for long term storage or sensor data.

Recent development and improvements to the data API have allowed Lokahi to begin accepting data from any of the available onboard sensors on iOS and Android devices. Even though the main focus is still infrasound, having access to all of the available sensors provides the ability to sense other sensor fields and to perform interesting data fusion techniques. 

A diagram of the Lokahi framework is provided in figure \ref{fig:lokahi}.


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/lokahi.pdf}
	\caption{Lokahi Design}\label{fig:lokahi}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Lokahi: Ingestion}
Unlike OPQ, Lokahi takes an approach of send and store everything from every sensor, all the time. This approach is vastly different than what we're used to in triggering based acquisition systems. Data between sensors and our Ingestion servers is encrypted using standard SSL encryption algorithms. Authentication and authorization for each sensor is accomplished using Json Web Tokens (JWTs) with signatures generated using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Data at the sensor level is serialized using protocol buffers and then compressed using LZ4. 

To enable the smooth retrieval of large amounts of sensor data, Lokahi uses a distributed actor system (Akka) to automatically scale horizontally based on the current volume of data being received. 

\subsubsection{Lokahi: Persistence}
Metadata is stripped from the sensor data at data ingestion and immediate stored to a distributed Mongo database. Metadata is indexed using a combination of device id and timestamps. 

Metadata drives the rest of the Lokahi framework and provides pointers to the raw data.

Raw sensor data is stored in a distributed key-value store. Lokahi uses Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) which provides automatic data redundancy and essentially limitless storage. Raw sensor data is stored by key and the key is stored in the metadata.

Raw sensor data is also persisted in an Apache Kafka queue. Kafka not only provides the framework with a message queue to pass data between distributed services, but it also acts as a ring buffer. Each sensor stores 1 hours worth of data in Kafka that can be looked up by any of the distributed clients and retrieved very quickly. For those reasons, Kafka powers IPC and data buffering roles for our real time analysis of Lokahi sensor data streams.  

\subsubsection{Lokahi: Analysis}
Analysis in Lokahi is provided by a set of distributed processes that were developed in Python using SciPy, NumPy, and matplotlib. Recent developments in the framework are now also including the basis for machine learning (ML) using Tensor Flow.

We provide real time plotting and analysis by subscribing to real time data feeds provided by the Apache Kafka real time queue and buffer. We also provide more robust batch analysis of historical data that can be initiated from Lokahi Web.


\subsubsection{Lokahi: Web}
Lokahi web is a web application for querying and performing analysis of real time sensor data or over historical sensor data. Lokahi also has built in system of health displays for providing a real-time and historic overview of the health of the distributed services within the framework.
