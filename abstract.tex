\begin{abstract}
I propose increasing the efficiency and decreasing energy usage within distributed sensor networks by doing three things. First, by creating a data hierarchy that designates the importance of data within a network. In this way, signals of interest are kept while sensor noise is reduced. Second, create the concept of distributed sensor network Phenomena, a layer above signal classification that provides predictive capabilities within sensor networks. Third, utilize the predictive models to increase triggering efficiency, increase signal detection, and decrease network sensor energy usage.
