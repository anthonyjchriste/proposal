\section{Overview of Distributed Sensor Networks}
Distributed sensor networks consist of any number of sensors that collect information about the environment around them. The sensors that make up these networks can either be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Distributed sensor networks are dynamic in that sensors can be added or removed from the network at any time. With the onset of the Internet of Things (IoT), itâ€™s easier than ever to build and deploy distributed sensor networks. Further, mobile devices, such as mobile phones, are seeing increased usage as intelligent sensing agents.

With all of these factors combined, management, collection, detection, localization, and analysis from distributed sensor networks is not a trivial task. The data collected from distributed sensor networks under certain circumstances can be considered Big Data. That is, distributed sensor networks create a large volume of data due to the abundance of IoT and mobile devices. Distributed sensor networks create a variety of data with different formats and data quality issues. Distributed sensor networks can produce data at high velocity. These characteristics of data produced from distributed sensor networks create a need for efficient architectures and specific algorithms designed for working with Big Data.

Further, sensor networks are often constrained in both computing power and available energy sources. This forces us to find comprises between data collection, onboard sensor processing, sensor communication, and network coordination.

This proposal focuses on identifying and tuning several features of distributed sensor networks. 

Triggering is the act of monitoring low fidelity feature extracted data and triggering sensors for high fidelity data streams when abnormalities are seen in the triggering data stream.

Detection is the algorithmic ability to detect signals of interest among a sea of background noise. Sensor networks often detect signals without knowing what they are or how to classify them. 

Classification is the act of associating a signal with a known designation.
